# ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è Rock Paper Scissors ‚Äî Web-Based Game

## üìå Project Overview

This is a classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed for quick, interactive play between a human and the computer. Players click on their choice, and the computer randomly selects its move. The game then determines the winner, updates the score, and displays a message with the result.

## üñº UI Layout

  * **Header** ‚Üí Displays game title
  * **Choice Buttons** ‚Üí Rock, Paper, and Scissors icons
  * **Scoreboard** ‚Üí Shows current scores for player and computer
  * **Message Container** ‚Üí Displays result of each round

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Game Flow

1.  Player clicks on Rock, Paper, or Scissors
2.  Computer randomly selects its move
3.  Game compares choices and determines outcome
4.  Score is updated and a result message is shown

### Outcome Logic

  * Rock beats Scissors
  * Scissors beats Paper
  * Paper beats Rock
  * Same choice results in a draw

-----

## üìú JavaScript Highlights

### State Variables

```js
let userScore = 0;
let compScore = 0;
```

### Core Functions

  * `genCompChoice()` ‚Üí Randomly selects computer's move
  * `drawGame()` ‚Üí Handles draw scenario
  * `showWinner(userWin, userChoice, compChoice)` ‚Üí Updates score and message
  * `playGame(userChoice)` ‚Üí Main game logic triggered on user click

### Event Handling

```js
choices.forEach((choice) => {
  choice.addEventListener("click", () => {
    const userChoice = choice.getAttribute("id");
    playGame(userChoice);
  });
});
```

-----

## üé® CSS Highlights

  * **Flexbox Layout** ‚Äî Centers choices and scoreboard
  * **Hover Effects** ‚Äî Highlights selected choice
  * **Responsive Sizing** ‚Äî Uses `rem` and percentages for scaling
  * **Color Feedback** ‚Äî Green for win, red for loss, blue for draw

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamiUrRehman065/StonePaperScissorsGame
cd ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser.

## üí° Possible Improvements

  * Add sound effects for win/loss/draw
  * Include animations for selected choices
  * Track win streaks or total rounds played
  * Add a reset button to clear scores
  * Implement multiplayer or AI difficulty levels

## ü™û Developer Reflection

This project helped me reinforce core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic. I focused on creating a clean, responsive UI, ensuring the game logic was intuitive and bug-free.

### What I Learned

  * How to use `querySelector` and `addEventListener` effectively
  * Managing game state and updating the DOM dynamically
  * Structuring code for readability and reusability

### Challenges I Faced

  * Ensuring the score updates correctly without glitches
  * Designing a layout that works well across screen sizes

### How I Solved Them

I modularized the logic into small functions and used consistent styling with Flexbox. Testing each interaction helped me catch edge cases and polish the experience.

### Why It Matters for My Portfolio

This project shows my ability to build interactive web apps with clean logic and user-friendly design. It‚Äôs a great example of combining front-end skills with game mechanics.
