# ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è Rock Paper Scissors ‚Äî Web‚ÄëBased Game

## üìå Project Overview
This is a classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed for quick, interactive play between a human and the computer. Players click on their choice, and the computer randomly selects its move. The game then determines the winner, updates the score, and displays a message with the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Game Flow
1. Player clicks on Rock, Paper, or Scissors  
2. Computer randomly selects its move  
3. Game compares choices and determines is updated and result outcome  
4. Score message is shown  

### Outcome Logic
- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Paper beats Rock  
- Same choice results in a draw

## üìú JavaScript Highlights

### State Variables = 0;
let compScore = 0;
```

### Core
```js
let userScore Functions
- `genCompChoice()` ‚Üí Randomly selects computer's move  
- `drawGame()` ‚Üí Handles draw scenario  
- `showWinner(userWin, userChoice, compChoice)` ‚Üí Updates score and message  
- `playGame(userChoice)` ‚Üí Main game logic triggered on user click  

### Event Handling
```js
choices.forEach((choice) => {
  choice.addEvent () => {
    constListener("click", userChoice = choice.getAttribute("id");
    playGame(userChoice);
  });
});
```

---

## üé® CSS Highlights
- **Flexbox Layout** ‚Äî Centers choices and scoreboard  
- **Hover Effects** ‚Äî Highlights selected choice  
- **Responsive Sizing** ‚Äî Uses `rem` and percentages for scaling  
- **Color Feedback** ‚Äî Green for win, red for loss, blue for draw

## ü™û Developer Reflection

This project helped me reinforce core JavaScript concepts, event handling like DOM manipulation, and conditional logic. I focused on creating a clean, responsive UI and logic was intuitive ensuring the game and bug-free.

### What I Learned
- How to use `querySelector` and `addEventListener` effectively  
- Managing game state and updating the DOM dynamically  
- Structuring code for readability and reusability  

### Challenges I Faced
- Ensuring the score updates correctly without glitches  
- Designing a layout that works well across screen sizes  

### How I Solved Them
I modularized the logic into small functions and used consistent styling with Flexbox. Testing each interaction helped me catch edge cases and polish### Why It Matters for My Portfolio the experience.


This project shows my ability to build apps with clean interactive web logic and user-friendly design. It‚Äôs a great example of combining front-end skills with game mechanics.
